# General
- provide a general mapping file (ask Prof. Cai)

# Java
- block varaibles with same name should be resovled.  
- override functions (same type but different parameters)
- support new definition of relations (only annotation left)
- support Annotation const
- support lamba expression
- support java 8 method reference


# C/C++
- resolve macros
- parse extends relations
- should resolve operator overriding
- function type of KnR
- find parameter related conditional statements
- use STL to check whether the template is handled completely
Macro should be unexpanded until last minutes, but some macros may neither vars nor functions, they could be certain informal format. **Which is difficult to handle **
 # Conditional Compliant Directives **Open** should we only handle the *visible* part, or everything of source code?
